"""
Another Matrix problem!
1) Create Rope class and write method to determine behaviour of Tail when Head moves. It always moves adjacent to the Head after a move:
    - when tail is in same row but different column, moves left or right 
    - when tail is in different row but same column, moves up or down
    - need to figure out diagonal movement
2) Will need to track location of head and tail (properties on Rope class)
3) Mark positions that Tail visits
4) Count the number of positions the tail has visited
